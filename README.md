```

`isOpened` A boolean to know the state whether a modal element is visible or not

`open` A function to open modal element

`close` A function to close modal element

`state` A custom state of modal element (it consists of predefined `isOpened` property, but you can redeclare it whenever you want to)

`set` A function to set custom state for the modal element

`setAndOpen` A function to set custom state and open a modal element (by changing its `isOpened` property)

`reset` A function to reset custom state (it resets state to object with `isOpened=false` when initialState is not defined)

`resetAndClose` The function does the same like `reset` does, but also resets modal element state and close it

`modalName` A unique identification for a modal element to refer to it easily in other places of an app
